			   TODO BUILD NOTES
			   ================

REQUIREMENTS

all modules:
  ocamlc
  ocamlopt
  g++
  gcc

cmdline module:
  readline
  camlidl

cgi module:
  ocamlnet (itself requiring pcre-ocaml, which of course requires pcre)
  ocamlfind (required by json-wheel, which is included as a sub-module)

todobot module:
  pcre-ocaml (itself requiring pcre)
  gloox (itself having numerous dependencies)

OTHER NOTES

Because of various OCaml implementation quirks, it is necessary to special-case
some build rules. These should be automatically handled as much as possilbe.
However:

1. Under cygwin, you must export OSTYPE=cygwin to trap special naming of
the readline runtime library.

2. cgi and todobot modules are untested on any platform other than Linux amd64.
